I am a second year MS/PhD student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst, 
advised by [David Jensen](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/jensen/) and I also work with [Ted Westling](https://tedwestling.com/) in the Statistics department.

My research revolves around the inference and estimation of parameters arising in causal inference using 
non/semi-parametric statistical models. I am working on a class of parameters s.t. non-pathwise differentiable (for example, dose-response curve over 
continuous exposure). Although I have worked mostly with nonparametric models, I am interested in leveraging semi-parametric constraints to the inference
and study its efficiency under such models (e.g., set of conditional independence and structured confounding). 

Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Engineering Statistics from Cornell University in 2019, 
where I was advised by [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/).  

Outside of Computer Science, I enjoy studying art history, particularly the philosophy developed by Guy Debord 
that our socio-cultural beliefs are governed by a photographic representation of the world instead of physical experiences. 
Living in the age of photographic representations, or the Spectacle, I am interested in the role of visual culture 
(e.g., films, architecture, typography) in defining both personal and socio-cultural concept of aesthetics.
