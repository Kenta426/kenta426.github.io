I am a first year MS/PhD student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst, 
advised by [David Jensen](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/jensen/). 
I am a member of [Knowledge Discovery Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/kdl/).

My research revolves around the inference and estimation of parameters arising in causal inference problems using 
non/semi-parametric statistical models. I work on these problems to develop consistent, robust, 
and efficient learning frameworks from both observational and experimental data.
I am interested in extending theories and methodologies of causal inference to off-policy policy evaluation 
and adaptive experimental designs.  

Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Engineering Statistics from Cornell University in 2019, 
where I was advised by [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/).  

Outside of Computer Science, I enjoy studying art history, particularly the philosophy developed by Guy Debord 
that our socio-cultural beliefs are governed by a photographic representation of the world instead of physical experiences. 
Living in the age of photographic representations, or the Spectacle, I am interested in the role of visual culture 
(e.g., films, architecture, typography) in defining both personal and socio-cultural concept of aesthetics.
